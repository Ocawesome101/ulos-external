*{NAME}
  wm - start the ULOS Terminal Manager

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${wm}

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${wm} is a basic terminal-only window manager.  It provides facilities for the creation and deletion of windowed terminals;  all else is left to the processes attached to the terminals.

*{USAGE}
  When ${wm} starts, it displays a solid light-gray background with the text

    *{Quit | ULOS Terminal Manager | Right-Click create/remove}

  in the top left corner.

  Right-clicking anywhere on the screen will create a new terminal window and attach a *{lsh}(*{1}) process to it.  Right-clicking a window will close it.

  Each window is by default 65x20 in size and uses a corresponding amount of GPU memory.  This means that, on a Tier 3 GPU with default configuration, there may be at most 18 windows open at any one time.  On a Tier 2 GPU, there may only be 3 windows.

  Clicking *{Quit} will exit ${wm}, freeing all allocated window-buffers, closing terminals, and killing the shells assigned to those terminals.

  ${wm} does not support nested instances.

*{CONFIGURATION}
  ${wm} is configured through #{/etc/wm.cfg}.
