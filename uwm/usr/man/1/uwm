*{NAME}
  uwm - start the ULOS Window Manager

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${uwm}

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${uwm} is a basic window manager.  It provides facilities for the creation and deletion of windowed applications;  all else is left to the application itself.

*{USAGE}
  When ${uwm} starts, it displays a solid light-gray background with the text

    *{Quit | ULOS Window Manager | Right-Click for menu}

  in the top left corner.

  Right-clicking anywhere on the screen will create a menu.  Hold down the right-click button and drag your cursor over the desired option.  All files under #{/usr/share/apps} are listed as options.  Release the right-click button to select an option.

  Selecting any application will load the corresponding application file and attach its returned UI data to the window tree.

  Each window is by default 65x20 in size and uses a corresponding amount of GPU memory.  This means that, on a Tier 3 GPU with default configuration, there may be at most 18 windows open at any one time.  On a Tier 2 GPU, there may only be 3 windows.

  Clicking *{Quit} will exit ${uwm}, freeing all allocated window-buffers and calling blue{:close} on all windows.

  ${uwm} does not support nested instances.

*{CONFIGURATION}
  ${uwm} is configured through #{/etc/uwm.cfg}.
