*{NAME}
  bsh - Better Shell

*{SYNOPSIS}
  ${bsh} *{-l}|*{--login}
  ${bsh}

*{DESCRIPTION}
  ${bsh} is a Bourne-like shell.  It is a significantly improved, and in fact rewritten, version of the *{sh} shell shipped with ULOS prior to Release 1.7.  It supports piping, input/output redirection, command aliases, basic glob expansion, and substitution.

  ${bsh} is prioritized over *{lsh}(*{1}) by the *{sh}(*{1}) utility, if it is installed.  *{lsh} is still available, and may be set as a user's default shell with the *{passwd}(*{1}) utility.

*{SYNTAX}
  This section contains explanations of the syntax of ${bsh}.  It should be familiar to those familiar with the Bourne shell.

  *{Environment Variable Substitution}
  Environment variables may be subsituted with the *{$}*{{}*{VARIABLE_NAME}*{}} syntax for variables whose names contain characters outside of the *{[0-9a-zA-z_]} range, and *{$VARIABLE_NAME} for those variables whose names do not contain such characters.  For example, the variable *{foo-bar} must be substituted with *{$}*{{}*{foo-bar}*{}}, whereas the variable *{baz} may be substituted with *{$baz}.

  *{Command Aliases}
  Aliases may be defined with the *{alias} builtin;  see *{BUILTINS} below.

  *{Glob Expansion}
  Globs with the *{*} character are supported in place of a filename, or the end of a filename at the end of a path specifier, or in place of a directory name anywhere else.  Thus, the following cases are valid:

    #{/bin/}*{*}
    #{/lib/}*{*}#{/test}
    #{/tmp/part*}

  The following case is not valid and will result in undefined behavior:

    #{/example/part}*{*}#{/foo}
